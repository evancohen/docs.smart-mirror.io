# Install Raspbian

**These instructions are specific to the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3**

To get started I suggest a clean install of Raspbian. You can snag a fresh copy of Jessie w/ Pixel [Raspbian Download Page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

For instructions on how to install Raspbian see \[How To Install Raspbian\(full\)\]\(/docs/howto/how\_to\_install\_raspbianfull.md "How To Install Raspbian\(full\)"\).

You'll also need to install Node \(v6.x\) which now comes bundled with npm.

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

##### Getting the code

Next up you'll want to clone this repository into your user's home folder on your Pi:

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror.git
```
