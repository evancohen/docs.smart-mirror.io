# Installation

The easiest way to install the smart mirror is via the 1-line installation script for the Pi 2 and 3. This script will install the smart mirror and it's dependencies:

```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evancohen/smart-mirror/master/scripts/pi-install.sh | bash
```

Once that script finishes running \(~15 minutes on a standard connection\) you'll want to [configure the mirror](configuration.md).

> Using another platform?  
> Something went wrong with the install?  
> Want to do things the old fashioned way?

That's OK. That's why there are manual installation instructions:

* [Install Raspberry Pi OS](installing_raspbian.md)
* [Install dependencies and run](install_dependencies.md)
