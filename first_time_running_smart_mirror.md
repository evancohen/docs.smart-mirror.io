# First Time Running Smart Mirror

 can launch the mirror with
```
npm start
```

## Errors
Note that if you start the mirror and get a white screen you most likely have an issue with your config. Often this is caused by a missing comma somewhere within the config. Use of an online javascript linter to help find common syntax errors. 

Have a different issue? Take a look at the [Troubleshooting Page](troubleshooting.md).
