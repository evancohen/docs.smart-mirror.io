# Introduction

This is the official documentation for the [smart-mirror](https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror). If you are reading this on [docs.smart-mirror.io](http://docs.smart-mirror.io), great! If not you should head on over.

The smart-mirror was inspired by [HomeMirror](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror) and Michael Teeuw's [Magic Mirror](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror). It was originally created in a weekend and is now maintained by a growing community of contributors and enthusiasts. 

Smart-mirror is voice controlled, integrates with a growing number of services, and can control your smart devices :)
