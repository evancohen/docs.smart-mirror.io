# First Time Running Smart Mirror

The smart-mirror is configured using the Remote Configuration Tool. This requires you starting the mirror.

Open the terminal and type:

```
npm start
or
pm2 start smart-mirror (if you selected yes to use pm2 to manage starting during install)
```

If you're running the mirror for the first time \(or for the first time since running upgrading to this version of the mirror\) you'll see a QR Code with a URL under it. From a phone or another computer \(on the same network as your Smart-Mirror\) you can open a browser and manually enter the URL. 

If you're not running the mirror for the first time and you've properly configured the Sound and Voice, say the keyword/hotword and then "Show Remote Link" to display the URL to reach the Remote Configuration Tool.

After going to the Home page click on Settings &gt; Configure the Mirror.
