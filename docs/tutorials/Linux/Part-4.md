# Install Manually on Linux
### Part 4 - Configure Linux

{% hint style='danger' %}
This guide is NOT intended for Raspberry Pi.

This guide is to be used when installing on a linux system. Most common reason for installing on a linux system is for development.

Due to the nature of diverse linux builds, we will keep this very generalized. However, Keep in mind this is done with Ubuntu Desktop in mind.

## Step 0

The fact is there are no steps for this. This is where we leave you to sort it out by yourself. Congrats! You've picked one of the most highly diverse Operating Systems available. We would never be able to fully tell you how to do this. 

We're not just bailing on you though. We will give you a list of things that should probably be done but not really required, however if you do it it will have you feeling accomplished and it will make your Linux build closer to the Raspberry Pi build. However you might not want to do any of this if you're using this Linux build for development. Either Way, you'll have to figure out how to do it with your version of Linux.

### Recommended things to do to "Configure Linux" like we would the Raspberry Pi:
  1. Disable the screensaver ([steps 1 - 4 in part 5 - configure The Pi](https://docs.smart-mirror.io/v/tuturial-version/docs/tutorials/Manual-Pi/Part-5.html))
  2. Configure unclutter to start on boot ([steps 5 - 6 in part 5 - configure The Pi](https://docs.smart-mirror.io/v/tuturial-version/docs/tutorials/Manual-Pi/Part-5.html))

Hopefully that points you in the right direction.
